									<h2>How It Works</h2>
									<p>DraftCodes is a daily publication that simplifies complicated strategies into digestible insights for upcoming sporting events.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="content">


									<h2>How It Works</h2>
									<p>At DraftCodes, we use our proprietary algorithm to collect data from various online sources to fuel our betting strategies.
									These strategies can be easily compared side-by-side to help identify the most ideal matchups for spread, total, and moneyline bets.
									Generally, we categorize our betting indicators into three categories.</p>

									<hr/>
									<h3>Sharp Money Analysis</h3>
									<p>Sportsbooks, like DraftKings, provide intricate analysis of where public bets and professional money are flowing.
										Professional bettors are commonly referred to as "sharps," and they can be a powerful indicator of which bets hold the most value.
										Our algorithm values circumstances where public bets favor one side, but sharps favor the opposing side.
										For example, if the Miami Heat (-5.5) are playing the Charlotte Hornets and 80% of bets made are on the Hornets to cover,
										but 80% of the handle (total money wagered) is on the Heat to cover, then it is fair to say that the people putting the highest dollar bets see value with the Heat.
										In other words, I would rather follow the sports bettor that places a single $100,000 bet versus 100,000 casual bettors putting down $1.
										<br> <br>
										At DraftCodes, we perform this analysis automatically and present it in a clear, concise way to show which games have strong sharp action.
										Considering sharp action, along with our other betting strategies, can help increase your win rates. As with every report we release,
										there is a separate tab with all the detailed statistics that drive these indicators.
										Please see below for an example of how our Sharp Money Analysis is shown in our daily DraftCodes report.</p>

									<h3>Historical Trend Analysis</h3>
									<p>Statistical metrics, trends, and averages can help you better understand games where betting lines deviate from the general performance of two teams.
										Many online sources provide predictive percentages, including sites like ESPN and SportsReference.com.
										One of the indicators we use is ESPN's FPI analytics tool, which assigns a percentage chance that either team will win the matchup.
										Bookmakers give implied chances of winning when they release moneyline odds. Our algorithm analyzes scenarios where ESPN and bookmakers deviate from each other significantly.
										In such cases, we identify the matchup and indicate which side holds value.</p>

										<div class="image"><img src="images/historical.jpg" alt="" /></div>
											<br> <br>

									<p>Recent trends and patterns also hold weight in this analysis.
										Our algorithm analyzes each team's recent matchups to see if there are generally "hot" or "cold" teams when it comes to victories and over/under total predictions.
										When a team on a hot streak is playing against a team on a cold streak, we indicate those matchups as ideal for betting.
										Additionally, if both teams tend to hit the over or under in their recent games, the likelihood that this trend holds is high.</p>

											<br>
											<hr>

									<h3>Negative Indicators</h3>
									<p>Not all indicators should be positive. Sometimes it is valuable to know when teams are showing substantial injury risk.
										For example, if LeBron James is out for the upcoming game, it may not be worthwhile to analyze other statistical measures
										involving the Lakers since their offense, defense, and efficiency will all be affected.
										Another measure of concern that we identify is when games are shown on big-time TV networks with a lot of viewership.
										More viewers generally mean more bettors, which can make markets more efficient and, therefore, harder to find value on either side of the spread or line.
										Our algorithm at DraftCodes identifies these scenarios and shows which games may pose risks.</p>

										<div class="image"><img src="images/negative.jpg" alt="" /></div>
										<br>
										<hr>
									<h3>Final Analysis</h3>
									<p>DraftCodes is meant to be a comprehensive tool for you to make better bets.
										It is up to you to determine how much you value each of our indicators.
										For example, one may value Sharp Action ahead of ESPN FPI or Historical Trend analysis.
										Also, you may disregard some metrics or decide to have non-negotiable exclusions - like when a team shows High Injury Risk.
										Some strategies may combine these indicators together. Imagine if the Hornets pose a high injury risk,
										and lots of Sharp Money is on the Heat. Perhaps strong money is following the heat because of the injury risk to the Hornets.
										All of these indicators can be filtered, mixed, and matched to fit your betting system.</p>

									<h3>Purpose, Goal & Next Steps</h3>
									<p>Our purpose at DraftCodes is to help you make quality bets in less time. Calculations, analysis, and statistics can take
									hours to go through, and sometimes matchups are not ideal to start with. Days with a large game slate,
									like Saturday or Sunday, could mean that analyzing 80 games becomes impossible.
									As a result, you may miss quality opportunities or overlook other chances to apply your strategy.
									DraftCodes simplifies your strategies into a clear visual chart that immediately compares several indicators.
									There's no need to check each team's injury report, recent games and averages, or where public money is flowing.
									<br> <br>
									Our plan is to continue implementing new strategies and statistical analysis for each game.
									There are always new ways to determine a betting edge, and our team continues to explore them.
									We also plan to roll out tools specific to all sports, such as soccer (MLS and Europe), NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, and college sports.
									This way, you can find tremendous value in all types of games and markets around the world.</p>
